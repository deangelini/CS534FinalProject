# CS534FinalProject
Worked with three other students to create and compare the performance of Pytorch and TensorFlow AlexNet CNNs, a Basic CNN, and an AlexNet Plus One CNN to identify fruit freshness. 

Main contributions were implementing the hyperparameter tuning for the PyTorch AlexNet CNN, Basic CNN, and the AlexNet Plus One CNN, helping to implement the initial stages of the TensorFlow AlexNet CNN, and conducting results for the PyTorch AlexNet CNN.
